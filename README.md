## Hello 👋

I'm Aina Balqis, a full-stack developer based in Malaysia.

I mainly work on frontend development using React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, with some animation magic using GSAP and Framer Motion. I also design in Figma, and I can jump into UX tasks when needed.

### Tools & Tech

React, TypeScript, Tailwind, GSAP, Framer Motion

**Design:**

### A bit about me
* I adore cats. I have a self-professed princess at home.
* I like building things — even if I don’t know how yet, I’ll still try to make it happen. Honest work, that's all that matters.
