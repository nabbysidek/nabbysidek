## Hello 👋

I'm Aina Balqis, a frontend engineer based in Malaysia.

I build things on the frontend with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind, sprinkle in animations, mess around in Figma, and love a good UX challenge.

### Tools & Tech
**Dev:**
React, TypeScript, Tailwind, GSAP, Framer Motion, PHP, Laravel

**Design:**
Figma, Illustrator, Photoshop, Affinity Designer, After Effects

### A bit about me
* I adore cats. I have a self-professed princess at home.
* I like building things — even if I don’t know how yet, I’ll still try to make it happen. Honest work, that's all that matters.
